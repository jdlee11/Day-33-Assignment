# Day 33 assignment: React-pardy!

## description
- this app will be a simple game of Jeopardy, with 6 categories and 5 questions per category.
- questions will be chosen by clicking on the appropriate dollar amount on the game board
- answers will be typed in when the question modal appears
- correct answers will add to your score, incorrect ones will subtract
- after answering a question (correctly or not), it's box on the game board will appear empty

## progress log
- just got a big chunk of the structuring work done. The '/' route goes to a page which contains a start button. pressing that takes the user to the board, which I have not yet populated with data, just placeholder text. I spent a few minutes styling the board, mainly each category title and question box, so now it looks presentable. I will improve the visuals once it is functional.
